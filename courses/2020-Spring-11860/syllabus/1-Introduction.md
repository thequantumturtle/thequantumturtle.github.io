    A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Summary
We will be class requirements and expectations. Then we will give a frame work for where quantum computers come from and why as an industry we are putting so much effort into such a difficult endeavour.

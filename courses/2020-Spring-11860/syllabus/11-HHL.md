### Before Class
Watch Seth Lloyd's lecture on HHL

### Summary
Systems of linear equation can find an exponential speed up on QCs. This algorithm will require computers outside of the NISQ era but opens the gateway to many advantages in Machine Learning.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

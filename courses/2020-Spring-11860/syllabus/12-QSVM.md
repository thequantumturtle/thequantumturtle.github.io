### Before Class
Read Chapter 13 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book
Read Peter Wittek and Maria Schuld Papers

### Summary
Quantum support vector machines are a great example of how a classical algorithm can experience quantum advantage in multiple ways. SVMs have fallen out of favor in recent years, but maybe with classically intractable implementations there is something of interest here yet again. 

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

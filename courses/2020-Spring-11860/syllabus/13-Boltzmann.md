### Before Class
Read Chapter 13 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book

### Summary
Quantum Boltzmann machines could be a revolutionary take on NNs. Quantum computers can utilize fully connected Boltzmann machines without taking the computational penalty of classical computers. 

We will go over the theory and small application of a QBM.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

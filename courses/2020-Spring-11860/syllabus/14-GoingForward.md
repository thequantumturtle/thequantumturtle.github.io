### Before Class
Finish your projects

### Summary
Time for reflection. Now that you know all the pros and cons of quantum computing what can you do in the future? Where is the research headed? Where is the private sector headed. 

Given time, any subject that the class votes on which has yet to be covered. Q Chemistry, Q Finance, Q Maxcut, etc.

### Notes
- We are at the end. Breathe. 
- You are one of maybe only a 1000 people in the U.S. who know this material. Congratulations.

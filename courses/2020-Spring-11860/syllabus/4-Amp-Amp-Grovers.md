### Before Class
Read Chapters 6 & 10 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book

### Summary
First we will learn about Amplitude Amplification - One of the first of the quantum primitives. While not amazingly useful by themselves, they help to make the building blochs of more impressive algorithms.

We will then dive into quantum search and Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm is provably better than any classical implementation, showing a quadratic speedup.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
- Read chapter 6 for Monday and Chapter 10 for Wednesday

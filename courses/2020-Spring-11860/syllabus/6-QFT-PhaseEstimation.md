### Before Class
Read Chapters 7 & 8 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book


### Summary
QFT is faster than the FFT! We will be showing how to encode signals into a quantum state and then perform a Fourier transform on the state. We will also be going over how to do a reverse QFT!



### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
- Read chapter 7 for Monday and Chapter 8 for Wednesday

### Before Class
Read Chapter 12 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book
Watch a lecture by Shor.
Read paper on cracking RSA 2048 in 8h10min

### Summary
Shor's algorithm is what truly ignited the QC space. With the promise of easily breaking RSA this makes QCs a serious threat to our current security technologies. Interestingly, Shor's algorithm is not provably faster than any classical algorithm. But... proving that may require the collapse of the P vs. NP problem, so don't hold your breath.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Guest Speaker from D-Wave on the 18th
Dr. Joel M. Gottlieb joined D-Wave in January 2016 as Senior Pre-Sales Analyst,
after 20 years in AT&T and AT&T Research. He earned a Ph. D from the University
of Wisconsin--Madison in condensed matter physics, after graduating from the
University of Michigan. At D-Wave, his role includes bringing new users to
the quantum computer, and researching problems which show the power of
the computer. He loves learning new subjects and new technology, and also
enjoys talking music.


### Summary
Quantum bits are unreliable and require error correction. Classical bits require error correction too, but not on this level. Lets explore what makes creating a good quantum computer so daunting. We will also look at some basical error correction strategies that can help you out on smaller circuits that you are currently running.


### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

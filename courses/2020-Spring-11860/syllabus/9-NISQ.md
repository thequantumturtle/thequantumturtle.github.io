Lets take a formal dive into some of the problems you have been experiencing first hand. Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers (NISQ Computers) are fraught with problems. How long will we be in the NISQ era? What can be achieved in this era? Are there algorithms that work well at this scale? Can Quantum Computers reach Quanutm Advantage during this period?

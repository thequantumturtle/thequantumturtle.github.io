    We will be working mostly out of this book.

#### Extra Reading:
- [ML w/ QC](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-83098-4)    
- [Gentle Book](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608150244118.pdf)    
    A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

### Summary
We will be going over class requirements and expectations. Then we will give a frame work for where quantum computers can aid in machine learning.

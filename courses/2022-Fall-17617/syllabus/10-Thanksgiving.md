title: Thanksgiving!

Amidst the quantum world, we pause and break,
Thanksgiving's grace, a respite we partake.
From qubits' dance and tensors' cosmic flight,
We savor moments, grateful for the light.

A quantum course, a journey vast and deep,
But in this season's warmth, we softly sleep.
With family and friends, we gather near,
In this Thanksgiving time, we hold them dear.

For while we delve in qubits' endless spin,
The heart finds solace in the love within.
With gratitude, we cherish moments shared,
In this QML break, a soul repaired.

## Before Class
Materials for this course are sourced from all aspects of literature. No one book will be used, but I do enjoy and suggest the books below:
#### Main Book: 
- [Octopus Book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683)   
    We will be working mostly out of this book.

#### Extra Reading:
- [Blue Book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965)    
    This book gives a great explanation on how to conceptualize Quantum Computers. First few chapters are great if you don't feel confident with the math.
- [Gentle Book](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608150244118.pdf)    
    A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Summary
We will be going over class requirements and expectations. We will then review Quantum Computers, their niche in the world and why optimal circuit mappings will aid their ability to fill said niche.

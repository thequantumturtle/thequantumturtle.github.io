### Summary
The Toffoli gate isn't as simple as one might think. A 3 qubit gate on a QC that only allows 1 and 2 qubit base gates? It just means that we must build the toffoli from other base gates. And its EXPENSIVE. We will find out how expensive, how to skirt around it and a potential replacement for the Toffoli gate: the Margolus gate.

### Summary
If Quantum Teleportation didn't live up to the Teleportation of you dreams well... maybe its time to start fettering expectations. But hey! Isn't Quantum pretty magical all the time?

Jokes aside, this is where you get to see a part of how the sausage is really made. Quantum computers do not have the control to create any arbitray quantum state with arbitrary quantum precision. Magic states will help us cope.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring your computer to class.

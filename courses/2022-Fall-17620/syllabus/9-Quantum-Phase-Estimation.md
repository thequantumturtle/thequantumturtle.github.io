title: Erratically Erroneous Equipment Endangers Everything

### Summary

I'm not sure if you are aware of this by now but Quantum Computers suck. They are the worst! They can't do much, and what they can do no one even cares about. And even at that, they need an extreme amount of help and supervision, costing more in man hours to make a simple algorithm work than a bay area startup trying to end world hunger. 

But hey! That also describes you at the age of 5. So give the poor guys a break.

And we are going to try and fix their little error proned ways. How you ask? With error correction! Once believed impossible, quantum error correction could pave the way to really awesome quantum computers that are all grown up!


### Notes
- Reminder to bring your computer to class.

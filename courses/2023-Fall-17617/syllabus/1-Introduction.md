## Before Class

### Books
#### Main Book: 
- [Octopus Book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683)   
    We will be working mostly out of this book.

#### Extra Reading:
- [Blue Book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965)    
    This book gives a great explanation on how to conceptualize Quantum Computers. First few chapters are great if you don't feel confident with the math.
- [Gentle Book](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608150244118.pdf)    
    A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Summary
We will be going over class requirements and expectations. Then we will give a frame work for where quantum computers come from and why as an industry we are putting so much effort into such a difficult endeavour.

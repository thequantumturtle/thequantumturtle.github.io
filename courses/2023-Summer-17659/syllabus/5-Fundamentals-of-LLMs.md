In this lecture, which will take place on May 30, we will delve into the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs). We will focus on understanding the underlying architecture and principles of LLMs, including popular models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers. We will explore how these models are trained on vast amounts of text data to generate coherent and context-aware responses. Additionally, we will discuss the applications and challenges associated with LLMs in various natural language processing tasks.

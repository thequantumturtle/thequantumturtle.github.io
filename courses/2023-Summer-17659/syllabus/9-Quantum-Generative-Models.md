Quantum generative models are like a magicianâ€™s hat ðŸŽ©. You never know what youâ€™re going to get! They use quantum mechanics to generate new data and are used in various applications such as the generation of probability distributions, drugs, and option pricing for financial applications. In quantum generative models, the underlying probability distribution describing correlations in data is generated by measuring a set of observables under a many-body entangled state. The goal of generative machine learning is to model the probability distribution underlying a given data set. This probability distribution helps to characterize the generation process of the data samples.

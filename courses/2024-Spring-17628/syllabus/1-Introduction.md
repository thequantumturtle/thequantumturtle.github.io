## Before Class

### Books

#### Main Book: 
- [Mike and Ike](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176)   
    We will be working mostly out of this book.

#### Extra Reading:
- [Quantum Information Science](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Information-Science-Riccardo-Manenti/dp/0198787480)    
    This book gives a great explanation on how to conceptualize Quantum Computers. First few chapters are great if you don't feel confident with the math.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Summary
We will be going over class requirements and expectations. Then we will give a frame work for where quantum computers come from and why as an industry we are putting so much effort into such a difficult endeavour.

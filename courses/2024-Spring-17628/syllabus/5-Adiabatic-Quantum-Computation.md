title: Adiabatic? You OK?
---

### Summary
Adiabatic computation is a form of quantum computing that leverages the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. This theorem states that a quantum system that is initially in the ground state (the state of lowest energy) of its Hamiltonian (a function describing the total energy of the system) will remain in the ground state of the Hamiltonian, even if the Hamiltonian slowly changes over time, provided the change is carried out slowly enough compared to the system's energy gaps. In the context of computation, this principle is used to perform calculations.

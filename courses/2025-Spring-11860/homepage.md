Monday and Wednesday (5:00pm to 6:20pm EST @ GHC 4215)   
### Instructors: [Daniel Justice](https://thequantumturtle.github.io/), [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/), [Rita Singh](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/rsingh/index.html) 
### TA: [Thomas Cantalapiedra]("https://thomas-scs.github.io/")


## Announcements!
The first few classes will be done remotely! Do **NOT** show up to GHC 4215 or else you will be lonely!
Class can be found on Zoom right **HERE** (Will be added later).

## Location
Doherty Hall Room 1211

## Important Links
**Piazza**: For announcements and communication.  Will be added later
**Canvas**: For those fun assignments that everyone likes to do.  Will be added later

## Course Goals
Students will gain familiarity with current universal gate quantum computing tools and technology. Students will also become comfortable with several QC algorithms and their implementation on state of the art quantum computer simulators and hardware. 

## Grading
30% Homeworks, 30% Group Project, 10% Participation, 30% weekly quizzes.

## Quizzes
Each week a quiz will be given. The worst one will not be counted.

## Prerequisites
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Linear Algebra

Students will **not** need an understanding of quantum mechanics.


Note: The syllabus is subject to occasional change. This is especially the case in the latter half of the semester once your professors have become comfortable with the group's overall skill level. Adequate notice will be given.

## Basic course structure

Most weeks are designed to be 1 day of lecture and 1 day of lab.

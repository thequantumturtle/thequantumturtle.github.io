## Course Overview
This course introduces core quantum computing concepts with an emphasis on algorithms, circuits, and hands-on implementation. Expect a mix of lecture and lab work covering quantum information fundamentals, gate-based computing, and modern applications in cryptography and machine learning.

## Logistics
Monday and Wednesday (5:00pm to 6:20pm EST @ GHC 4215)
### Instructors: [Daniel Justice](https://thequantumturtle.github.io/), [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/), [Rita Singh](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/rsingh/index.html)
### TA: [Ryan Wang](https://ryan-twang.github.io)
### Zoom: [Join the class](https://cmu.zoom.us/j/99820694854?pwd=WkpFTHFzRlBUUkNqWGpFSlhHaDdqUT09) (use for remote sessions)

## Location
GHC 4215

## Important Links
[**Piazza**](https://piazza.com/class/mk4a0cn1bgr6qt): announcements and communication. <br>
[**Canvas**](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/51095): assignments and course materials.  
[**Syllabus**](/courses/2026-Spring-11860/syllabus/): printable course syllabus.

## Communication norms
Homework, assignments, and course materials will be posted on Canvas. Questions, comments, and informal course communication will take place on Piazza. Important communications, including absences, should be emailed directly to the instructors. Class recordings may be released upon request to Dr. Raj.

## Course Goals
Students will gain familiarity with current universal gate quantum computing tools and technology. Students will also become comfortable with several QC algorithms and their implementation on state of the art quantum computer simulators and hardware. 

## Books
#### Main Book (recommended):
- [Octopus Book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683)  
  We will be working mostly out of this book. It is also available through CMU's [O'Reilly Online subscription](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-quantum-computers/9781492039679/).

#### Extra Reading:
- [Blue Book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965)  
  This book gives a great explanation on how to conceptualize Quantum Computers. First few chapters are great if you don't feel confident with the math.
- [Gentle Book](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608150244118.pdf)  
  A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

## Grading
30% Homeworks, 30% Group Project, 10% Participation, 30% weekly quizzes.

## Prerequisites
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Linear Algebra

Students will **not** need an understanding of quantum mechanics.

Note: The syllabus is subject to occasional change. This is especially the case in the latter half of the semester once your professors have become comfortable with the group's overall skill level. Adequate notice will be given.

## Basic course structure

Most weeks are designed to be 1 day of lecture and 1 day of lab. 

## Labs
- [Lab 1: Classical vs Quantum Information](/courses/2026-Spring-11860/labs/lab-01/)
